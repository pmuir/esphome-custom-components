/*
 * An ESPHome component for the I2C leaf sensor made by Tinovi. 
 * It's based on their Arduino example code which is in LeadArduioI2C but replaces the various delays
 * they use with a very basic state machine, and uses millis() to work out when the sensor is ready
 * to avoid blocking the loop.
 * 
 * It publishes both the temperature reading in (degrees celsius) and the wetness reading (%).
 *
 * To use it, enable the I2C bus:
 *
 * ```
 * i2c:
 *     scan: true
 *     sda: GPIO32
 *     scl: GPIO33
 * ```
 *
 * Add the includes under `esphome:`
 * 
 * ```
 * includes:
 *   - custom_components/tinovi-leaf-sensor/tinovi_leaf_wetness.h
 *   - custom_components/tinovi-leaf-sensor/LeafArduinoI2c/LeafSens.h
 * ```
 * 
 * and the custom component:
 * 
 * ```
 * sensor:
 *   - platform: custom
 *     lambda: |-
 *       auto sensor = new LeafWetness(5000);
 *       App.register_component(sensor);
 *       return {sensor->temperature_sensor, sensor->wetness_sensor};
 * 
 *     sensors:
 *       - name: "Temperature Sensor"
 *         unit_of_measurement: Â°C
 *         accuracy_decimals: 1
 *       - name: "Wetness Sensor"
 *         unit_of_measurement: "%"
 *         accuracy_decimals: 1
